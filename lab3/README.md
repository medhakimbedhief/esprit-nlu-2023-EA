Prompt Techniques :
Add Prefix: One simple technique is to add a fixed prefix to each input text. For example,adding the prefix "Classify this tweet as real disaster or not: " to each tweet text before feeding it into the language model.

Add Location: This technique appends the location of the tweet (if available) to the text of the tweet, separated by a space.For example, you could add the location "New York: " to a tweet that was sent from New York.

Add Keyword: This technique appends the keyword of the tweet (if available) to the text of the tweet, separated by a space. For example, if a tweet is tagged with the keyword "emergency", you could add the prefix "Emergency tweet: " to the tweet text.
